Steps to run the code:

1. Run `make` in the current dir.
2. Run `java restaurant` in the current dir.
3. The program starts and prompts for the input file. Enter the name of the input file now.
4. The output is printed to the console.

NOTE: for inputs corresponding to diner's arrival time and number of various items ordered, if they don't fall in the specified range, then the appropriate message will be printed on console and the corresponding diner is refused entry into restaurant. The program then proceeds with the remaining valid diners.
